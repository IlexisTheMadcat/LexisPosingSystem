# LexisPosingSystem
Lexi's Posing System, or LPS, is a tool for VRChat avatars that allows users to carry and pose up to 3 clones of their avatar and/or other avatars they've created.
Unlike other takes on posing systems, this system uses _too many to count_ parameters to control a shared armature for the puppets. The parameters are used to store information about the puppet transform data to allow for persistence and various quality-of-life features.

Far more will be written here later.
